# Conway-Game-Visualizer
Conwayâ€™s Game of Life

### Description:
This project is an implementation of the classic Conway's Game of Life in Python, 
using FastAPI to serve the simulation in real time via WebSockets. 
The visualization is done on an HTML5 canvas, allowing the grid to evolve in the browser.

The goal of the project is to create a "live wallpaper" or dynamic display that shows how 
virtual cells are born, live, and die according to the rules of Conway's cellular automaton.
